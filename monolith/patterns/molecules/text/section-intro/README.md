The section intro is a common pattern optionally included used to introduce both sections and blocks. It consists of a headline group, introductory paragraph, and an optional link.

It is structurally similar to a call to action, but a call to action should always have all three elements, the section intro should only require a headline.

Section intros used as introductions for blocks should probably never include a link; the block pattern has a separate link that is presented after the block.
