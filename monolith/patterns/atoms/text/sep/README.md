This pattern can be used to add a separator between pieces of content. It does not have content itself; the separator style can be overridden with css and by providing different separator skins.

Since there is no instance where this element has user-defined content or is empty (and will probably never be called directly by the CMS), there is no checking of the pattern variable before output.
