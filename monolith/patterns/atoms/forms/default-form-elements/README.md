Form elements produced by Drupal can be very difficult to manipulate because Drupal maintains very tight control of them. This can make it hard to design forms; it also makes it difficult to style forms by attaching class names to all of the elements. This pattern establishes baseline styles for form elements, but individual, highly-designed forms will need individualized attention.
