# Pre-Publishing Checklist
**STOP!** Before you hit “Publish,” make sure your page meets the following criteria.

_Does this content..._

## Usability
* Fulfill an important user goal?
* Answer a question your audience might actually have?
* Include a link to more details, if there are any?
* Organize information in a way an outsider might expect?

## Voice and Tone
* Communicate one of the university’s key messages?
* Convey the brand appropriately?
* Speak in active voice?
* Use a personal, human-to-human tone?
* Use “we” and “you” when speaking about the university or department?
* Explain acronyms?

## Optimize for Screen Reading
* Use headings, subheads, and bullet lists for easy scanning?
* Link to related content on other pages?
* Use descriptive keywords in links, rather than “click here” or “learn more”?
* Include a call to action?
* Include meta tags, alt tags, and a descriptive URL?
