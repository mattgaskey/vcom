# NewCity Web Image Guidelines
In most cases, the content management system will automatically size and/or crop images to fit their containers, which are programmed to adjust responsively to fit the dimensions and resolutions of different users’ screens. 
Even with the built-in auto-sizing and cropping functions that the CMS provides, it’s best to select images with their specific placement and component in mind. Some components require specific dimensions or aspect ratios for images to display properly. If so, these will be noted in the CMS itself where you upload or choose the image for a component. For components that don’t require specific dimensions, here are some general width guidelines to make sure images aren’t so small they appear blurry or so large that your pages take too long to load.

## Standard Image Widths
Size an image by width based on the largest place it will appear on the site. 

|Image Display Size|Small to Medium Image| Full-Width Image|
|---|---|---|
|*Examples*|Teasers, thumbnails, routing blocks, profile headshots|Page headers, backgrounds, edge-to-edge and full bleeds|
|*Minimum*|800 pixels|1680 pixels|
|*Maximum*|2000 pixels|2700 pixels|

### File Specifications
* Resolution of 72 pixels per inch at the maximum size it will display
* RGB color model (not CMYK, which is used for printing)
* JPG format for photos, PNG for graphics and illustrations. Never use TIFF for web photos, their large file size causes slow page loads and usability problems.
* 3 MB maximum file size
* Use descriptive filenames (not “DSC001.jpg”)
* **Include a descriptive alt tag for each image** to comply with accessibility guidelines.
