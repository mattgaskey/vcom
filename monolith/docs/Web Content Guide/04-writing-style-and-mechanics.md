# Writing Style and Mechanics

## Voice and Tone
An organization’s brand voice works just like a person’s. The tone changes according to the situation — lighthearted for an event announcement, to-the-point in a campus safety policy — but the voice is the personality that remains consistent. 
Use brand and messaging guides to inform the institutional voice in your writing (what to say and not say), and use these guidelines to craft your tone depending on the context (how to say it). 
### First and Second Person
Web content should have a conversational tone, addressing readers as though you were speaking directly to them. Use the first-person plural (“we”) to refer to the school, department, or unit you're speaking on behalf of, and second-person singular (“you”) to speak directly to the user so your content will sound approachable instead of detached or impersonal.

**Less like**
* _Students who wish to change a major or minor offered under the Department of Biology must submit a completed Change of Major and/or Minor form._

**More like**
* _Use this form if you want to change a major or minor from our department._

### Contractions
Use contractions for common phrases, "we don't" or "you’ll" or "it's." It may seem informal coming from an organization, but this small change makes text seem more like natural conversation, and has become a common practice in web writing.
### Plain Language
Users come to your site with specific tasks already in mind, and information buried in long, difficult text slows them down and gives them a negative impression of your university or department. Research shows that online readers and [even experts prefer plain, simple language](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-domain-experts/) to formal, academic-style text on the web. 
#### Things to avoid:
* **Internal jargon.** Avoid any terms you would need to explain to a new person. 
* **Overused marketing language.** Use specific examples to make your point more meaningful, rather than clichés that could describe any organization, such as: 
..* _our unique, innovative programs_
..* _world-class facilities_
..* _engaged faculty_
..* _cutting-edge research_
* **“Academic” words.** Avoid words like “utilize” or “methodologies” when a simple “use” or “methods” will do. 
* **Acronyms.** Spell out on first reference, and eliminate altogether when possible.
* **Branded terms.** Creative names and clever acronyms for internal initiatives don’t belong in page titles, navigation menus, or other places where external audiences might get tripped up by them. Instead use the terms your audience will already know and introduce the proper noun version in the intro text or subheader.

## Show, Don’t Tell
Instead of telling people what you want them to think with adjectives like “exciting” or “groundbreaking,” show what you mean with proof points that support your case, so users can come to those conclusions on their own. Avoid vague terms like “various” or “a number of”; use specifics like:
* Rankings and statistics (don’t say “numerous,” give them a real count)
* Participation rates for programs and internships
* Testimonials from people who have been there
* Specific examples, e.g., past research project titles, former study abroad destinations

For example, your mission page may say you believe in teaching through hands-on experience, but if your curriculum pages don’t show what those experiences feel like — through photos, videos, testimonials, examples, and descriptions — you’re missing an opportunity to practice what you preach. 

One powerful story can convey a lot more meaning than broad general language that encompasses all the possibilities. 
## Format for Online Reading 
People read web pages very differently from print materials, or even other digital media like email and newsletters. Even the best writing will fail if it’s not formatted to accommodate [online reading behaviors](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/). These guidelines help users scan, comprehend, and retain information:
 * **Make the page purpose clear [within 10 seconds](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/)**. If users aren’t sure they’re in the right place, they’re more likely to click elsewhere in the site or leave altogether. 
* **Write less, say more**. A standard mobile screen fits approximately 100 words. Divide text into paragraphs of 50 words or less. Try to not have more than 100 words between headers. And you should almost never have sentences longer than 25 words. 
* **One-sentence paragraphs and fragments are OK**. Really. And so is starting a sentence with “and.” 
* **Use inverted pyramid style** like a journalist (especially for content-heavy pages). Put the most important information right up top, using short, simple sentences. 
* **Cut out greetings, transitions, and framing phrases** like “the following information” or “welcome to the department.” Say what you mean in as few words as possible. 
* **Do not use “click here for...” or “learn more” in link text**. Just link a few words that describe the page or thing that you’re linking to, which will help users scan the page and navigate more easily. 
* **Use subheads** that summarize what readers will find in the paragraphs below. Scan the page. Could the reader get a sense of what it says just by reading the subheads? 
* **Convert sentences with lists into bullets**. It creates visual space that [helps readers scan](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/presenting-bulleted-lists/).
* **[The first 11 characters](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning/)** of a header are about all that users searching for information read before skipping to the next thing. Use short, simple words in subheads, and start with the most important words. (“Program Requirements” rather than “Information About Pre-Application Requirements.”)

## Style Guide
Consistency matters on the web. There are many different versions of “correct” depending on who you ask, but agree on a single style guide for everyone to use on the website to help keep the user experience cohesive. 

### Style Items to Define Internally and Publish Widely
* Serial comma
* Capitalization style of headlines
* Capitalization of common nouns (“the university,” “biology major,” “Department of Biology”)

* Time formats (5 p.m., noon)
* Numbers (one through nine, 10-100; dimensions, measurements, percentages, ages)
