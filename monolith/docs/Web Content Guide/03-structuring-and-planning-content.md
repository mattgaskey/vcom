# Structuring and Planning Content

## Balance User and Organizational Goals
Most online content has multiple needs and audiences to balance. Here are some important questions to ask for every piece of content: 

### User Needs
* What do people who visit this page want to know? What questions do they have?
* What did they come to our site to do? Is there a task they’re trying to complete?
* How should you balance/prioritize multiple audiences and varying goals? 
### Organizational Factors
* What is the larger goal of your company or organization? 
* What sets you apart from your competitors? How can you demonstrate that here? 
* How does this piece of content fit in with the rest of your messaging? 
* How will you evaluate the effectiveness of this content?
### Site Architecture/Navigation 
* Where does this fall along the user’s path through the site? 
* What’s their next step? What should this page link them to? 
### Brand Standards
* Does this piece of content support your brand and messaging goals? 
### Search Engine Standards
* Should this page be optimized for certain search keywords?
* What metadata text will encourage users to click?
* What words would users who are looking for this content type into a search engine? Are there terms that better fit their natural language patterns?
### Design Requirements
* Does this page need photos? What kind, size, and dimensions? 
* Are there graphic elements that could support the content and enhance the layout, like callout boxes, routing blocks, or pull-quotes?
### Functional Specifications
* Are there word count limitations for any structured content areas?
* Does this need to support any relationships to other pieces of content in the CMS (linked pages, taxonomies, views/feeds/snippets, etc.)?

The user’s goals should be the focus that drives each piece of content, with organizational goals, site structure, branding, competitive landscape, and other factors forming its context. What you say and do should be rooted in user needs, but how you say and do it is shaped by the other factors. 

One of the benefits of writing for digital media is that you can test what’s working and what isn’t and adjust accordingly. If your content isn’t driving the intended user action (or getting the desired user feedback), rethink it and update it. 

## Layering Content
Delivering too many facts at once puts a heavy cognitive burden on your readers. But breaking it out into many tiny pieces requires them to click and load a new page for each small chunk of information, raising your site’s [interaction cost](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/).

It’s better to organize content into clear, distinct categories designed to drive quick choices and link to increasingly detailed content as you move them deeper into the site’s architecture.

If a page is so long it’s obscuring what’s important, break into several; if it’s too short, combine it with a related one. The key to layering content is to provide the right amount of information at the right time, guided by empathy for the reader.

* Organize links into groups of 3-7 choices.
* Divide routing pages into chunks of no more than 50 words per section. Give just enough info for users to make a choice and click; you can go into more detail at the next level down. 
* Provide a little more context on pages that describe the features of a program or process in more depth, then send them deeper for exceptions, policies, logistics, and other specific details.
* Be thorough on pages that represent the end of the user’s road, like instructions, explanations, and timelines. Long pages are perfectly fine at the most advanced level of detail, when a user has found what they’re looking for and is ready to sit back and read. 

## The Right Amount of Context
Not all users enter the website from the home page. Any page of your site could serve as the front door, depending on a person’s search query or what link they came across in an advertisement, reference article, or social media site. That means even pages that are designed for internal audiences must be understandable to a new user and represent the university well. 

On top of that, audience research shows that prospective students don’t just browse the admission section of the website, or the department they’re most interested in. Instead, they hop around looking at student life, faculty profiles, the course catalog, career services for current students, events and activities, and other seemingly internal content for clues on what their experience as a student would be like to determine whether your school will be a good fit.
There’s no need to dumb things down for newcomers. But you should provide important contextual cues by: 
* Keeping site navigation simple and well-organized at every level, not just the top ones
* Spelling out acronyms on first reference
* Linking to pages with more detail, and 
* Aiming for a [10th- to 12th-grade reading level](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/legibility-readability-comprehension/) 

Your section of the site might not only be for prospective students, but it’s also for prospective students. So take the time to look at your content through the eyes of someone who has never heard of your department before. 
It’s also important not to overdo it by cluttering up the page with too much context. If the organization’s name is clearly visible somewhere else on the page, like the header, navigation menus, or breadcrumbs, there’s no need to introduce yourself in full every time — just say “we.” 

## Optimize for Mobile
Even if you’re just migrating existing pages into a newly responsive website design, you can eliminate some immediate problems that might render your pages illegible on a phone or tablet:
* **Convert files** that open in desktop-based programs. Recreate Microsoft Word docs and PowerPoint slides in HTML format. Use accessible PDFs for stand-alone printable documents like student handbooks, but don’t hide important information in files users have to download.
* **Take essential information out of the sidebars.** If something needs to display near the top of a page, put it there in the main text field. Sidebars often get bumped to the bottom when they stack on a mobile screen.
* **Avoid using tables** for non-comparative information. They get mangled on mobile screens, so consider converting to a simple list, image, or PDF. If you do use a table, use as few columns as possible, and don’t let cells span across multiple rows or columns. 
* **Check pages with complex graphics or layouts on a phone** and flag any that need a designer or developer’s help. Infographics and certain combinations of layout elements can cause display problems on mobile devices that aren’t apparent on a desktop screen.
