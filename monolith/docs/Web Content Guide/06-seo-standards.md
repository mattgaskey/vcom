# Search Engine Optimization Standards
## On-page Optimization			
It’s important to consider how people will find the pages you publish. Sometimes users will browse using navigation menus or type an address into their browser directly. But new users often find your content by searching. Many technical aspects of search optimization are built into your content management system. But there are some things you can do in your content to make it easier for search engines to see it, determine what it’s about, and suggest it to people who might be looking for it on their search results pages. 
### Use Their Vocabulary
Recent updates to search engine algorithms mean that certain manipulation techniques like “keyword stuffing” are no longer effective, and may even count against your ranking score. But search engines still run on search terms, so the single most important thing you can do to make a page visible is to use words that match your audience’s search queries. 
That means using vocabulary that your users would think of on their own rather than proper names for programs and services, acronyms, or technical terms that may be more precise but don’t match the way new users would think about them. You can use internally branded words in the body text on the page, just make sure that you pair them with explanations that make sense to an outsider.
### Keywords
The most important places to use search-friendly keywords are:
* Page titles
* URL paths
* Subheadings
* Link text
* Navigation menu labels
* Filenames for photos, PDFs, and other media assets
* Alt tags for images

The simplest way to choose keywords is to think, “what would my target audience type in the search field to get this page as the answer?” 
If you want to optimize a page with a specific keyword or search phrase, the best rule is to write for humans first, search engines second. Focus on one keyword phrase per page, incorporating it into headers and every 100 words at most. Be careful not to make your page sounds like spam (which will turn away readers and hurt search engine rankings). Not all pages need keyword optimization; the ideal length is 200–550 words, so you can repeat a keyword phrase three–six times “organically.”

## Metadata
Most content management systems have a separate tab or panel on the content entry screen where you can enter text explicitly for search engines to use in their rankings and results pages. Here are some of the basics, listed in order of importance for SEO, accessibility, and usability. Search engines change their ranking parameters all the time; for more details, [Moz’s SEO guide](https://moz.com/learn/seo/on-site-seo) is a good, regularly updated resource.

### Alt Tags
Alt tags are descriptions of an image or graphic; you must include an alt tag for every image to [meet accessibility compliance guidelines](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/). If you’re optimizing a page for a particular keyword phrase, include the phrase in the alt tag, as well as in the filename of the image.

### Structured URLs
It’s important for a URL to communicate what the page is about and where it lives in your site’s content hierarchy. Most CMSes will set the default URL based on page titles and parent relationships in the site structure. But if you’re writing your own URL:
* Use real words instead of reference ID numbers or abbreviations that a user wouldn’t type into a search engine
* Use lowercase letters only
* Use hyphens to separate words (instead of underscores or spaces)
* Keep them short but still understandable

### Meta Titles
This is the linked title that displays on a list of search results, as well as the title that appears in the browser tab. It should begin with a descriptive page title and usually end with a consistent branding construct, e.g., “Majors and Minors | University Name.” Search result pages display the first 50-65 characters including spaces, and browser tabs display only the first few characters, so keep these as brief as possible while still being functional.

### Meta Descriptions
This is the text that displays beneath the link on search engine result pages. It tells users whether your page will answer their question or not compared to the other pages in the list. Search engines will automatically fill them in using text at the top of the page as a default, so setting meta descriptions is optional, but can be helpful for pages that are important entrances to your site or that are often found through search. Meta descriptions should be unique for each page (not boilerplate) and contain no more than 300 characters including spaces.
