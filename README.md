# Drupal 8 Site for VCOM

This is the repository for the VCOM D8 site. This repository contains both the Fractal styleguide (/monolith) as well as the custom theme and modules for Drupal.

Fractal houses the CSS, Javascript, and most of the template markup that is used in the Drupal theme. CSS and Javascript changes happen in Fractal. Most template changes, including the creation of new components, also happen in Fractal.

The Drupal material in the repository is limited to the theme and custom modules.

Local development is assisted by several Docker containers, not included in this repo.

My main involvement with this project was the creation of Fractal Twig templates from design comps using TailwindCSS, as well as integration of those components into Drupal Twig templates.  I have also carried out all maintenance since launch of this site in late 2019.
